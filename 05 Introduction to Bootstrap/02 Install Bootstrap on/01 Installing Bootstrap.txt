In index.html boiler plate


1)
What is CDN? Copy Bootstrap CDN : Content Delivery Network

We know internet is delivered by submarine cables
If i access server from usa to uk 
These are pretty long cables and generates few ms delay
avg time = 2 seconds


2) Why CDN? many routing points

A CDN  instead of hosting in just 1 single location
They have it at bunch of points where that website can be accessed

Location of short distance is looked at.
Enables users to loadCSS,JS, Images remotely from its servers

It downloads files unless it has cached

Bootstrap CSS files are hosted on maxcdn which has lots of routing points across worlds

3) How many routing points help?
If user tries of load website that is using bootstrap
It can access it relatively quickly no matter where

4) Why browser caches it?
Bootstrap css gets cached in browser when a user uses bootstrap website.This cache is then used to open any other bootstrap website.
This is how almost all websites using bootstrap are openable on most computers. Its like a network

Code will get downloaded  once -> later time retrieved from cache
