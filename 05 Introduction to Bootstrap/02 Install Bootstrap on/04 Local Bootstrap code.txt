Option 2 : dont use CDN, download all source code in CSS folder and link the bootstrap.css file in our index.html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.css" 


What is disadvantage of keeping code locally:
Prevents caching on browser

Browsers wont recognize this, and will download all these files locally instead of getting
from their cdn url
