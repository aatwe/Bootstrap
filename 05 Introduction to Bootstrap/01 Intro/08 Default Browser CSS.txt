In browser similar to bootstrap there is user agent style sheet.  //see in dev tools

1) Inspect basic code in chrome -> dev tools
2) In styles tab -> whichever tag  your code is in ->  //see User agent stylesheet

THis is the default CSS that gets applied to website by browser


If you add some class name it will automatically style in specified way
