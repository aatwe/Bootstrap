Based on whether it is colored section or white section?

For ex

Title: colored section

Feature: white section


Testimonial : colored

Press:  colored

Pricing: white

CTA : colored
footer: white

//We know we add color to colored section and white color to other sections
//Create styles for these sections:
.colored-section {
}

.white-section {
}

//keep common features in colored/white section
And if any subtle changes in some section, override in that particular section CSS
