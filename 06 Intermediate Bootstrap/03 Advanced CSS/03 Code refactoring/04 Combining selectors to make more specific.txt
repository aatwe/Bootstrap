How to apply styles to particular elements in webpage more specifically by combining selectors
Basically more drilled down CSS
How to combine selectors?


Hierarchy is read right to left
element on right is inside parent left
//Works only for parent child relationship
For ex
div  .title {
  color: red; 	//Wont work
}

1) 
//Apply to multple html elements by Grouping
//space not mandatory
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: "Montserrat-Bold";
}


selector1, selector2 {
   
}
_____________________________
Ex 
h1 {			or 		h1 , p{
   color: red;				  color: red;
}					}
p{
  color: red;
}
=================================================

2) Hierarchial Selectors
Syntax:  //there should be space
selector1 selector2 {

}

Ex1) 
//Targetting container fluid class inside id title
#title .container-fluid {
    padding-top: 3%;
    text-align: left;
}

Ex2) Given below hierarchial combination of selectors
	Read from right to left
	Reads all h1 inside a div
CSS
div h1 {color: red;}  	//All h1s inside div get colored red

HTML
<div class=  "container-fluid">
   <h1 class= "title"> </h1>

How to make it more specific?
.container-fluid #title {color: red;}	//Element with id title inside a parent with class
				container-fluid should have text color red
	This is why ids are supposed to be unique
