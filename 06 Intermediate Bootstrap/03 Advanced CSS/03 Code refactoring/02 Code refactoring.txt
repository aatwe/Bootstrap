1) Structure 

	Make finding things efficient
	Keep HTML elements together
		Keep body , h1, h2, h3,p together


There are 7 instances where we have declared text-align : centre
	Make the entire body :
		text-align: center;
	Delete other instances


We wo;; [it [addomg om container-fluid
and delete other instances of padding 7% 15%


Problem with container-fluid having padding
Pushes down nav bar at top
inspect ->   check container-fluid padding
	so we will remove padding just for container fluid at title section

<body>

  <section id="title">
    <div class="container-fluid">

      <!-- Nav Bar -->
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark ">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href=""> tindog </a>


We want to give container fluid a custom class
But container-fluid is a bootstrap class that is helpful in keeping website responsive

So instead we will target title instead of container fluid

Pther option? Combine some selector


instead of adding padding to title section 
We target container-fluid class inside title section

How to do that?
#title.container-fluid {
  padding: 3% 15% 7%
}
