lot css code applying same thing : last one standing gets carried through in the end
Inefficient and bug prone

1) use ID sparingly
	If you have only 1 item of something, dont give it an id
	Consider using class first instead of using id right away

2)  When using your own custom class , use only 1, bootstrap class is ok

3) Avoid Inline Styles at all cost
	Really Bad CSS practice
	Inline styles can always be solved using external style sheet
