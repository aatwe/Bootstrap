//No space is needed		//Note when there is space, its hierarchial and read right to left
//Read left to right

can be element-class
            element-id etc
But all should occur in the same element

selector1.selector2 {

}
______________________________________________
For ex

HTML
<div class="container-fluid"> 
  <h1 class = title>   
        Hello World
</h1>
</div>

CSS:
h1#title {color: red;}	    //h1 that has id title should have color red  		//Works
div.container-fluid {color; red;}  // div has class containerfluid that should be red	 //Works

//It doesnt matter if we are combining id or class with html element 
As long as no space between selector, it will work

div#title {color: red;}	//hierarchial : there is no div with id or class title	//Doesntwork
				div has a child with id title
