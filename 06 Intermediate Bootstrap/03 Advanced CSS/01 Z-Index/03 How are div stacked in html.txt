Z index works on absolte/relative position ele

We will see 3 div stacked on  top of each other 
Code top to bottom = bottom to top of screen  //Natural stacking order
//How to change the stacking order? Move the div down the html code
What if we dont want to change the bits?How to change stacking order?
	Use CSS -> Z-index property
	Changing the z-index of the div to 1

1:   Closest to user
-1: away from user
//Changing z-index of all div to -1 wont make and difference. same stacking order

Why complex topic? Many things affect the stacking order
What is prerequisite for z-index? Position property
position: absolute in div{} css 
//deleting this makes all div position statically i.e dont have explicit position set

What if only 1 div was position: absolute;


what is default z index for each element? 0

HTML
<div class= "red">
     Red				
</div>
<div class="yellow">		
     Yellow			
</div>	
<div class="blue">
      Blue
</div>

Is it becuase my divs are not overlapping?
Lets make only first div position absolute
//seeing below: yellow should be stacked on top but it doesnt
Why? it is not positioned, t doesnt have either relative or absolute positioning,it is static
//since no position zindex does not apply
//if you give position(absolute/fixed) to yellow it will come on top.
Note if you give it position:static it wont work //it is same as no position defined
.red{position: absolute
	z-index:1 ;}
.yellow{z-index:10;}
.blue{ //no z index}
