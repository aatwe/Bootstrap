Positioned elements that come later in html flow are on top
even if they dont have a z-index

i.e we can remove z-index  for #features and it will still work

i.e if neither have z-index -> if one is below other in html flow
			i.e feature section is below title image
			the below one i.e feature will be on top even without setting z-index
