Make website look beautiful on mobile tablet and laptop and desktop
We did all of this just by using CSS breakpoint
Generally with braoadstroke responsiveness we can do a lot with Bootstrap grids
For fine tuning and narrowing down exact design we want for mobiel tablet and laptop
We will find using CSS media queries

2 ways to design responsive website?
1) mobile first
2) design for desktop and make it responsive for smaller sizes

Tablet size: Change position of image from 
absolute   //taken out of html flow and it doesnt take its own space
to 
static 	//it starts taking full amount of space it needs


We want it to transform and rotate back into straight axis
i.e image should be straight
Also centre align the text in title so it doesnt look so weird being left alligned

Bootstrap grids:  The point at which the medium side triggers

When width < 1028 it starts looking weird
How to target this size? with Media query


//Now as you go smaller than 1028 image becomes static and it gets back into html flow
and is not cut off
//also rotate it
//centre allign title text
@media (ma-width: 1028 px){
  .title-image{
     position: static; 
     transform: rotate(0);
}
} 
#title{
  text-align: center;
}
